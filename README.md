# ds18b2x-spin 
--------------

This is a P8X32A/Propeller driver object for Dallas/Maxim DS18B2x-series temperature sensors.

**IMPORTANT**: This software is meant to be used with the [spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/spin-standard-library) (P8X32A) or [p2-spin-standard-library](https://github.com/avsa242/p2-spin-standard-library) (P2X8C4M64P). Please install the applicable library first before attempting to use this code, otherwise you will be missing several files required to build the project.

## Salient Features

* One-wire connection
* Read device serial number
* Read temperature (Celsius, Fahrenheit)
* Set resolution

## Requirements
